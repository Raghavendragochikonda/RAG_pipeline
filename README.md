## **1. Introduction**  
The **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline is an advanced hybrid model that combines **retrieval-based** and **generation-based** methods for text generation. This project implements a RAG pipeline to enhance knowledge-grounded responses by integrating retrieved relevant data from a document repository or database.

---

## **2. Project Overview**  
This project aims to:  
- **Retrieve** the most relevant documents or text from a knowledge base using search techniques.  
- **Generate** accurate, contextually relevant responses using a language model (e.g., GPT or similar LLM).  
- Seamlessly combine retrieval and generation to improve the performance of text-based tasks like question answering, summarization, and chatbots.

---

## **3. Features**  
- **Hybrid Retrieval**: Retrieve relevant documents using vector search (e.g., FAISS).  
- **Contextual Generation**: Generate human-like responses based on retrieved data.  
- **Customizable Pipeline**: Modify components for different retrieval or generation backends.  
- **Scalable Design**: Works on small and large datasets efficiently.  
- **Preprocessing Support**: Includes data cleaning and embedding creation.  

---

## **4. Architecture**  
The RAG pipeline consists of two main components:  
1. **Retriever**: Fetches relevant documents from the knowledge base.  
2. **Generator**: Generates the output text based on the retrieved documents.  

High-level workflow:  
1. **Input Query** →  
2. **Retriever** (e.g., embeddings search using FAISS or BM25) →  
3. **Context Integration** →  
4. **Generator** (LLM for text generation) →  
5. **Output Response**.

## **5. Setup and Installation**  

### **Requirements**  
- Python 3.8+  
- Libraries: PyTorch, HuggingFace Transformers, FAISS, LangChain, etc.  
- Pre-trained model (e.g., `facebook/rag-token-base` from HuggingFace).  

### **Steps**  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rag-pipeline.git
   cd rag-pipeline
   ```  

2. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```  

3. Download embeddings and datasets (if needed):  
   ```bash
   python setup_data.py
   ```  

---

## **6. Usage**  

### **Running the RAG Pipeline**  
1. To run the pipeline for a sample query:  
   ```bash
   python main.py --query "Your question here"
   ```  
2. The output will include:  
   - Retrieved documents  
   - Generated response  

---

## **7. Dataset**  
The RAG pipeline can use any **text corpus** as the knowledge base. Examples:  
- Wikipedia data  
- Custom datasets (e.g., FAQs, documentation, or research papers).  

To preprocess and embed the dataset:  
```bash
python preprocess.py --data "data/your_dataset.txt"
```

---

## **8. How It Works**  

1. **Data Preparation**:  
   - Text corpus is tokenized and converted into embeddings using models like **BERT** or **SentenceTransformers**.  

2. **Retrieval Step**:  
   - Query embeddings are matched with the document embeddings using a **vector search engine** (e.g., FAISS).  

3. **Generation Step**:  
   - The query and retrieved documents are passed to a language model (e.g., GPT) for final response generation.  

---

## **9. Technologies Used**  
- **Python**: Programming language.  
- **HuggingFace Transformers**: For pre-trained language models.  
- **FAISS**: Vector similarity search for fast document retrieval.  
- **LangChain**: Pipeline framework for LLM applications.  
- **PyTorch**: Deep learning backend.

10. Results**  
The RAG pipeline improves:  
Accuracy: Generated responses are grounded in retrieved information.  
Relevance: Answers are context-aware and domain-specific.
